The Graduate is a 1963 novella by Charles Webb , who wrote it shortly after graduating from Williams College . It tells the story of Benjamin Braddock , who , while pondering his future after his graduation , has an affair with the older Mrs. Robinson , the wife of his father 's business partner .   It was adapted into the highly successful 1967 movie The Graduate , directed by Mike Nichols and with Dustin Hoffman in the title role . Webb has stated he never felt comfortable with the attention the movie brought him because he felt it distracted from his status as a serious artist . He did not receive any royalties from the film and has stated he is glad it happened that way .   On the episode of the AMC television show Movies That Shook the World devoted to the film adaptation , Webb revealed the identity of the real-life inspiration for Mrs. Robinson : Jane Erickson ( exact spelling unknown ) , the wife of an associate of Webb 's father . However , that was the extent of any similarity with the novel ; Webb denied having a relationship with her .   A sequel titled Home School , which takes place ten years after the ending of the first novel , was published by Hutchinson in June 2007 .   The book 's creation serves as the centerpiece of the 2005 film Rumor Has It ...

Common Era or Current Era ( CE ) is a year-numbering system ( calendar era ) for the Julian and Gregorian calendars that refers to the years since the start of this era , i.e. , since AD 1 . The preceding era is referred to as before the Common or Current Era ( BCE ) . The Current Era notation system can be used as a secular alternative to the Dionysian era system , which distinguishes eras as AD ( anno Domini , '' -LSB- the -RSB- year of -LSB- the -RSB- Lord '' ) and BC ( `` before Christ '' ) . The two notation systems are numerically equivalent ; thus '' CE '' corresponds to `` AD '' and `` 400 BCE '' corresponds to `` 400 BC '' . The year-numbering system for the Gregorian calendar is the most widespread civil calendar system used in the world today . For decades , it has been the global standard , recognized by international institutions such as the United Nations and the Universal Postal Union .   The expression has been traced back to Latin usage to 1615 , as vulgaris aerae , and to 1635 in English as `` Vulgar Era '' . The term `` Common Era '' can be found in English as early as 1708 , and became more widely used in the mid-19th century by Jewish academics . In the later 20th century , the use of CE and BCE was popularized in academic and scientific publications , and more generally by authors and publishers wishing to emphasize secularism or sensitivity to non-Christians , by not explicitly referencing Jesus as `` Christ '' and Dominus ( `` Lord '' ) , shortened from anno Domini nostri Jesu Christi ( `` in the year of Our Lord Jesus Christ '' ) .

The words `` Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds '' - while by no means an official creed or motto of the United States Postal Service - have long been associated with the American postman .  The motto is inscribed on New York 's James Farley Post Office , but it has no official status .   The phrase can be found in block letters on the James Farley Post Office in New York City , facing Penn Station . It was a translation by Prof. George Herbert Palmer , Harvard University , from an ancient Greek work of Herodotus describing the angarium , the ancient Persian system of mounted postal carriers c. 500 B.C. . The inscription was added to the building by William M. Kendall of the architectural firm of McKim , Mead & White , the building 's architects . It derives from a quote from Herodotus ' Histories , referring to the courier service of the ancient Persian Empire :   Nonetheless the USPS does occasionally cancel deliveries in unsafe weather conditions .
